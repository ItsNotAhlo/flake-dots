# My NixOS config but in flakes
As I'm writing this. I'm legit watching a VM attmept to build this config to spare my main machine from suffering.

## I'm learning okay?
I've got [LibrePhoenix](https://www.youtube.com/@librephoenix) on my other monitor with [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_WcXIXdDWWpuypAEKzZF2b5PijTluxRG) on how to use flakes for NixOS.
This is super early stages and the only reason this is public is so I don't have to log into git on my VM. Plus it's kinda nice having public repos.
